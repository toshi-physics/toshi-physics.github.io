		<h1> Hi there! </h1>
		<p> I am slowly migrating my work here. In the meantime, have you made firends with <a href="/index.html">Batuk</a> yet? </p>
		<p> I have a list of recent <a href="/projects">projects</a> and <a href="/andanotherthing/">writings</a> up. Rest soon to follow.</p>
		<p> It has taken me a while in my life to begin to collate all my scattered blogs into one cohesive tapestry. But I learned from my wiser friends that a patchwork collage is just fine.</p>
