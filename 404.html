  <p><strong>This is the story of a webpage named Strayley.</strong></p>
  <p>Strayley worked for a website in an even bigger website where he was Webpage #404.</p>
  <p>Webpage #404's job was simple: it sat at its address linked to a DNS and it waited for people to push buttons on a 
keyboard.</p>
  <p>Orders came to it through a monitor on people's desks telling it what buttons they pushed, how long they pushed them 
for, and in what order.</p>
  <p>This is what webpage #404 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul 
rending, Strayley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though it had been made exactly for this job.</p>
  <p>And Strayley was happy.</p>
