I'm a grad student at UC Santa Barbara in the [Marchetti 
group](https://marchetti.physics.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener 
noreferrer"}. I work on theoretical and computational Epithelial Rheology in collaboration with the [Pruitt 
Lab](https://pruittlab.engineering.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I've previously studied spatiotemporal interaction 
dynamics of E. Coli. and temperate lambda phages; Autonomous Boolean Network formalism of chemomechanical regulatory networks involved in 
bone remodelling; and detection of mu-neutrinos in Liq-Ar Time Projection Chambers.

I am interested in understanding why living systems, biological or otherwise, behave the way they do. I was trained as an Engineering Physicist 
at [IIT-Bombay](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener
noreferrer"}â€”neither an engineer nor a physicist but a secret third confluence of the two.
