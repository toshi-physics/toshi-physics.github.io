I'm a grad student at UC Santa Barbara in the [Marchetti 
group](https://marchetti.physics.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener 
noreferrer"}. My work broadly encompasses the mechanics and patterning of cells and tissues. I'm currently playing with modelling nematic cells growing atop nematic substrates inspired by the wonderful [work](http://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2023.0160){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener
noreferrer"} by Yimin Luo. In the past I've attempted theoretical and computational Epithelial Rheology in collaboration with the [Pruitt 
Lab](https://pruittlab.engineering.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Before starting my PhD I studied spatiotemporal interaction 
dynamics of E. Coli. and temperate lambda phages; Autonomous Boolean Network formalism of chemomechanical regulatory networks involved in 
bone remodelling; and detection of mu-neutrinos in Liq-Ar Time Projection Chambers.

I am interested in understanding the physics of biology. Why do living systems behave the way they do? I was trained as an Engineering Physicist 
at [IIT-Bombay](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener
noreferrer"}â€”neither an engineer nor a physicist but a secret third confluence of the two.
