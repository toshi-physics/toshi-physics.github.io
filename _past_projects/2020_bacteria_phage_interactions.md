Lambda phages infect E. Coli in two stages. Just after infection is a period of calm before the storm, the lysogenic phase. 
In lysogeny, the rod-like E. Coli, instead of dividing, keep growing into large and thick filamentous rods almost two to three times the length of an uninfected E. Coli. The next phase is a lytic burst. The virus which has been multiplying inside the filamentous E. Coli bursts out. E. Coli famously grow as a field of nematics over which the newly created phages will surf. How does the competition between growth, alignment, and infection play out? We study this in experiments and agent-based simulations.

This study was presented in a [talk at March Meeting 2022](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/T05.7) by my collaborator Dr. Godwin Stephenson.
