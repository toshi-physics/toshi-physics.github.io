Junior year summer research at the [Laboratory for Bone Biomechanics, ETH Zurich](https://www.bone.ethz.ch), I studied the effects of external stress on bone regrowth and remodelling in humans. I worked on an autonomous-boolean-network formulation of the mechanochemical interactions involved in bone remodelling and worked on simulations which implemented it in experimentally obtained 3D strain fields.
