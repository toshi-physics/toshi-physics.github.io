How do epithelial cells confined in 1 dimesional long fibronextin patterns respond to external perturbations, like localised boundary step-strains or oscillatory strains? We study this local rheological response in theory (continuum model) and simulations (phase field and vertex models) to understand experimentally observed rich phenomena.

I presented some early results in a [talk at APS March Meeting 2023](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/D06.2).
I will be presenting some polished results in a [talk at APS March Meeting 2024](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR24/Session/T27.11).

Schematic of a 1D vertex model (pink cells, green cell-cell vertices) with dynamical rest length and chemomechanical couplings that give rise to persistent spatiotemporal waves as seen in experiments, ours and [previous](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.168101). Attached blue bead applies local boundary perturbations to the cell line.
