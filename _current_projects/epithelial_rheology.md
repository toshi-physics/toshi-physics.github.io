How do epithelial cells confined in 1 dimesional long fibronextin patterns respond to external perturbations, like localised boundary step-strains or oscillatory strains? We study this local rheological response in theory and simulations to understand experimentally observed rich phenomena.

I presented some early results in a [talk at APS March Meeting 2023](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/D06.2).
