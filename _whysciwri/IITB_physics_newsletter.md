I wrote for the dept. newsletter towards the end of my first year, some tidbits about quantum computing which interested me the most back then. We were studying digital electronics, fourier transforms, and Hadamard gates in various courses and I summarised my few internet rabbithole reading sessions on these topics in an article.
I edited [the newsletter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9vehvNX9_81aGhoa3BBR2NTVVdEM3Y0SGR0Q2haMzNTc1NV/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-IcLbjGeB5xrIdex8WDeLHg) in my senior year, the Golden Jubilee year of the institute and Physics department. Here we invited the youngest soldiers and the old guard alike to write about the department and its journey, its resource limited journey with the weight of expectations of a young indipendent nation all the way to its survival through Y2K panic.
