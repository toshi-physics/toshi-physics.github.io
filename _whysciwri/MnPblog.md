I wrote a few [blog posts](https://mnp-club.github.io/blog/) as a convener 
of the undergraduate Maths and 
Physics club. These were on 'recent' breakthroughs, concerning Hawking 
radiation and the first realisation of a qubit. My aim was to convey my 
understanding distilled through primary and secondary sources in a 
language friendly to any STEM undergraduate. These few blog posts were my 
first foray into science communication. The bug never left me and finally 
I got to interact with 
professional science communicators and reporters three years later at the 
National 
Center for Biological Sciences, and the Indian Institute of Science,
in Bengaluru. I got to discuss the urgency, necessity, and theory of 
sci-comm 
with peers and veterans over coffee and balmy Bengaluru winter air. Our 
discussions took an urgent and sensitive turn since this was the winter of 
2020, and soon our ideas had to be put into practice as COVID-19 dealt 
heavy blows to the community. I still try 
to inculcate all those ideas into presentations and public interfacings, 
but here nest the humble beginnings.
