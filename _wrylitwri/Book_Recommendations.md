## Authors with a relatively short oeuvre
Although often misguided, fame and familiarity cling to an author's most approachable and best works. I have always found it a safe bet to start from the most reviewed piece to get to know an author's style. These are some names whose works I have drunk, in uncontrollable binges through times tough and easy, through days full of light and nights without -

- Arundhati Roy
- Bohumil Hrabal
- Khushwant Singh
- David Foster Wallace (I know, I know, I know)
- Alfred Jarry
- Siddhartha Mukherjee
- Virginia Woolf
- Vladimir Nabokov

## Standalone Stars

- Midnight's Children. Salman Rushdie's classic taught me how to read literature. No doubt the book takes its playful language from Indianisms which most non-South Asian readers might miss out on. But I whole heartedly agree with, and still remember, the disappointment in the voice of my mentor from my undergraduate days, Prof. Pradeep Sarin, when we talked of how none of Rushdie's later works even come close to this colossal magnum opus.

## Curated Book Series
Museums are my sanctuaries, and their existence is bound to that of curatorsâ€”humans who carry the mantle of preserving, under muted spotlights, representative endeavours of humanity. As a book-bound child growing up among peers and dears who showed no interest similar to mine, I looked to the curators for direction. I have kept this habit safe, and in doing so, found many treasured books and writers.
