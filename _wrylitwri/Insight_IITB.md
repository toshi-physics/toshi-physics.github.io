For the entirety of my undergraduate stay at IIT Bombay I wrote for the student Media body, Insight. The work involved writing, surveying, interviewing (personal and event interviews), event-hosting, online-content-creation, and copy-editing. A lot of the work is now scattered in various print isues and youtube videos, and some was lost in the great migration from the old website, some is preserved here-

I was awarded the highest student journalism award, the Institute Journalism Colour in 2019 for my work. Although flawed and unpolished, I remain proud of my contribution to the discourse held and information debated at the institute.
