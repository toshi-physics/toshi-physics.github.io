          <h2>Beep-boop, there you are... (au contraire, this site isn't quite there yet.)</h2>
	  <p>Meet Batuk, the bacterium. They like to frolic around on the soft agar, ambling by, tumbling here and there, 
munching on the glucose-rich agar honeyed by their human in a colossal petri dish. Unbeknownst to Batuk, this 
petri dish shares more features with Dante's third than just its proverbial circularity. But Batuk isn't bothered. You can make 
friends with Batuk easily by luring them with food - just press on the agar to watch them throw caution (and tumbles) to the wind for 
some yummy food!</p>
